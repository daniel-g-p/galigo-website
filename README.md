## 1. Motivation
The GaliGo website was built to present the businesses' offerings that are set to launch in 2023. My role was not only to develop and deploy the site from scratch, but also to create the website design. I was also largely responsible for the development of the actual brand and business strategy during my time interning at 3D Aerospace.

## 2. Features
The website features everything you would expect from a company site, including an about page, products page, and contact form. There was a particular focus on encapsulating as much content as possible in dynamic sliders in order to make the pages appear clean and simple yet packed with information for those user who are interested in the details.

## 4. Development
The project was developed strictly under BEM class naming conventions and component-based thinking, all while being coded mobile-first given the target market of the brand.

## 5. Status
Currently serving as a static source of information, the website is projected to be turned into a fully functional eCommerce solution once the product is fully developed
